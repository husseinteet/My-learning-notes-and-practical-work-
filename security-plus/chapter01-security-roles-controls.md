# Security+ Chapter 01 – Comparing Security Roles and Security Controls

## Main Idea
This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of information security,
focusing on security principles, roles, frameworks, and security controls
used to protect organizational assets.

---

## Information Security
Information security refers to the processes and practices designed to
protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
modification, or destruction.

---

## CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is a core security model consisting of three principles:

### Confidentiality
Ensures that data is accessible only to authorized users.
**Examples:** encryption, access controls, data masking.

### Integrity
Ensures that data is accurate and has not been altered without authorization.
**Examples:** hashing, checksums, file integrity monitoring.

### Availability
Ensures that data and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.
**Examples:** redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans, system maintenance.

---

## Non-Repudiation
Non-repudiation ensures that a user cannot deny performing an action,
such as sending a message or accessing a system.
**Examples:** digital signatures, audit logs.

---

## Cybersecurity Frameworks
Cybersecurity frameworks provide structured guidelines and best practices
to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks.

**Example:**
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)

---

## Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit responsible for:
- Monitoring security events
- Detecting threats
- Incident response
- Reporting and analysis

---

## Security Control Functional Types
Security controls can be classified based on their function:

### Preventive Controls
Prevent security incidents before they occur.
**Examples:** firewalls, access controls, authentication mechanisms.

### Detective Controls
Detect and record security incidents.
**Examples:** intrusion detection systems (IDS), logs, monitoring systems.

### Corrective Controls
Respond to and fix security incidents.
**Examples:** system patching, incident response actions.

---

## Security Control Categories
Security controls can also be classified by type:

- **Physical controls:** locks, alarms, security guards.
- **Deterrent controls:** warning signs, security policies.
- **Compensating controls:** alternative controls used when primary controls
  are not feasible.

---

## Standards and Best Practices
International standards provide guidance for implementing security controls.

- ISO/IEC 27000 series: Information security management
- ISO 31000: Enterprise risk management

---

## Benchmarks and Secure Configuration Guides
Secure configuration guidelines help reduce system vulnerabilities.

- System hardening (removing unnecessary services and accounts)
- Network configuration best practices
- Application security configuration
- Monitoring and logging

---

## Key Takeaway
Understanding security principles, roles, and controls is essential for
building a strong security foundation and managing organizational risk.
