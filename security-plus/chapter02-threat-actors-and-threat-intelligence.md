# Security+ Chapter 02 – Explaining Threat Actors and Threat Intelligence

## Main Idea
This chapter explains the relationship between threats, vulnerabilities, and risk,
and introduces different types of threat actors and attack methods used against
organizations.

---

## Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk

### Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, process, or configuration
that can be exploited.
**Examples:** software bugs, misconfigurations, weak passwords, unpatched systems.

### Threat
A threat is any potential event or actor that can exploit a vulnerability.
Threats can be intentional (cyber attacks) or unintentional (natural disasters).

### Risk
Risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

**Relationship:**
Vulnerability + Threat = Risk

---

## Threat Actors
Threat actors are individuals or groups that pose a risk to an organization’s security.

### Internal Threats
Threats originating from inside the organization.
- Can be intentional or unintentional

### External Threats
Threats originating from outside the organization.
- Can also be intentional or unintentional

---

## Types of Hackers

- **White hat:** Ethical hackers who help organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Black hat:** Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
- **Gray hat:** Hackers who may violate ethical or legal boundaries without malicious intent.

---

## Attack Surface and Attack Vectors

### Attack Surface
The total number of points where an attacker can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
**Examples:** network services, applications, user accounts, hardware.

### Attack Vectors
The methods or paths used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
**Examples:** phishing emails, malware, compromised credentials.

---

## Components of the Attack Surface

- **Physical surface:** hardware devices.
- **Network surface:** routers, switches, firewalls, open ports and protocols.
- **Application surface:** web applications, APIs, mobile apps.
- **User surface:** user accounts, permissions, and credentials.

---

## Common Attack Vectors

- **Phishing:** malicious emails or messages.
- **Malware:** viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware.
- **Social engineering:** manipulation of users to gain access.
- **Network attacks:** man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS).

---

## Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence involves collecting and analyzing information about threats
to understand attacker behavior and improve security defenses.

---

## Key Takeaway
Understanding threat actors, attack surfaces, and attack vectors helps organizations
identify risks and implement appropriate security controls.
